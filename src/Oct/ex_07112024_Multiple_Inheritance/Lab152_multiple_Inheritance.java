    // No need to import if classes are in same package
    // if they are not in same folder or package-- then you need to use the import keyword and make the class public-- will see in encapsulation
    // In java multiple inheritance is not possible directly as JVM might get confused in case of same variables used in both the super class and which variable value should a child class must consider.
